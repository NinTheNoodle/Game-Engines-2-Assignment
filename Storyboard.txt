The camera emerges from behind a mountain and starts following some bombers on their way to a carpet bombing run.
The bombers are flying in formation using offset persue, with the leader following a path.
The bombers have a few fighters following along as protection. The fighters are flying above the bombers.

Just after the carpet bombing starts, the bombers get intercepted by fighter planes and a dogfight breaks out.
The bombers are all destroyed and the camera begins following one of the bomber assisting figters as it flees the scene with the enemy fighters chasing it.

The fighter pulls a nonsense menuver and starts flying backwards firing at the enemy fighters. The camera pulls up to the side of the action.
Out of nowhere the fighter smashes into a mountain because it was not paying attention.
The enemy fighters disperse.

The enemy fighters use seek when chasing the fighter combined with some elements of the flocking behaviour (such as keeping aligned with the other fighters).
