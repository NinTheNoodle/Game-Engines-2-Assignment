The camera looks around an idilic village, and settles framing a plane landed on the ground. After a moment a formation of bombers is seen near the top of the frame flying in offset persue.
The plane takes chace after the bombers and opens fire but is repelled. The plane then flys around to the locations of other planes on the ground.
As it passes near the other planes they take off too. The planes then enter a dogfight with the bombers as well as some fighters on the bombers' side.
The outcome of the battle is not determined. If the bombers win then a bombing run occurs on the village.
If the fighters win then the fighters split and fly off screen and the camera looks back at the village.
